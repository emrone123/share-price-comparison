##Requirements Investigated in Detail with Careful Consideration of All Aspects

**Investor**

Context: Investors need secure access to their personal data and the ability to register and log in to the application.
Challenges: Ensuring secure and safe authentication and protecting user data from unauthorized access.
Solutions: Implement robust password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and secure session management to protect user credentials. Use encryption.

**Corporate Decision Maker**

Context: Corporate decision makers require reliable storage and retrieval of past share price data for analysis.
Challenges: Ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval, especially with large datasets.
Solutions: Use a robust relational database with indexing and caching mechanisms to improve performance. Implement regular backups to prevent data loss.

**Market Researcher**

Context: Market researchers need the application to handle errors to ensure the correct data is given.
Challenges: Network instability can affect data retrieval, leading to user frustration.
Solutions: Implement local caching to store data temporarily during network outages. Use retry mechanisms to attempt data retrieval multiple times. Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

**Risk Manager**

Context: Risk managers need tools to assess market risks based on historical share price data.
Challenges: Processing large volumes of historical data and applying complex statistical models.
Solutions: Use data aggregation techniques to handle large datasets. Implement statistical models like VaR and CVaR to assess volatility. 
Provide customizable risk assessment parameters through an intuitive interface.

**Financial Analyst**

Context: Financial analysts require graphical tools to visualise and compare share price data.
Challenges: Ensuring smooth performance with large datasets and providing interactive features.
Solutions: Use efficient charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js) to handle large datasets. Implement interactive features like zooming and panning.
Allow customization of graph settings and comparison of multiple datasets.



**Requirements Organised and Presented Effectively**

•	Dependencies: Dependencies between requirements have been identified, such as the need to fetch data before it can be stored or displayed, ensuring a logical development sequence.
•	Prioritisation Matrix: A prioritisation matrix has been created to guide resource allocation and task scheduling. High-priority requirements, such as data fetching and storage, are marked as critical due to their foundational nature. Medium-priority requirements, including input validation and error handling, are also essential but offer more flexibility in implementation timing.


**Requirements Aligned to Overall Goals of Project**

•	User Authentication: Supports secure access to personal data and preferences.
•	Data Storage: Enhances usability by allowing offline access to data.
•	Graph Display: Provides a visual tool for comparing share prices, aiding in analysis and decision-making.
•	Input Validation: Ensures data integrity by validating user inputs.
•	Error Handling: Improves user experience by managing errors gracefully and providing clear messages.
•	User Interface: Enhances usability with an intuitive and responsive design.
•	User Preferences: Provides flexibility and convenience by allowing customization and saving of preferences and graphs.ddd
•	Security: Protects user data and ensures compliance with privacy regulations.
