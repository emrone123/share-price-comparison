Requirements Investigated in Detail with Careful Consideration of All Aspects (10 Marks)
Each requirement has been thoroughly investigated to ensure all aspects are carefully considered and feasible within the project constraints:
User Authentication:
a.	Implementation of user registration and login functionalities to provide secure access to personal data and preferences.
Data Storage:
b.	Local storage of retrieved data to allow users to access it offline, enhancing usability and ensuring data availability.
Graph Display:
c.	Development of features to display time-series graphs for one or two companies' share prices, enabling users to visually compare and analyze performance.
Input Validation:
d.	Implementation of input validation to ensure user inputs are correct and logical, maintaining data integrity.
Error Handling:
e.	Implementation of robust error handling to manage API errors effectively and provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
User Interface:
f.	Design of an intuitive and responsive user interface that works well on all devices, enhancing user experience.
User Preferences:
g.	Implementation of features for customizing user preferences and saving custom graphs, providing flexibility and convenience.
Security:
h.	Implementation of data encryption and secure authentication methods to protect users' sensitive information and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
Requirements Organized and Presented Effectively (5 Marks)
The requirements have been organized and presented in a clear, structured manner to facilitate understanding and implementation:
•	Dependencies: Dependencies between requirements have been identified, such as the need to fetch data before it can be stored or displayed, ensuring a logical development sequence.
•	Prioritisation Matrix: A prioritisation matrix has been created to guide resource allocation and task scheduling. High-priority requirements, such as data fetching and storage, are marked as critical due to their foundational nature. Medium-priority requirements, including input validation and error handling, are also essential but offer more flexibility in implementation timing.
Requirements Aligned to Overall Goals of Project (5 Marks)
All identified requirements are closely aligned with the project's overall goals, which focus on building a robust, scalable, and user-friendly Share Price Comparison Web Application:
•	User Authentication: Supports secure access to personal data and preferences.
•	Data Storage: Enhances usability by allowing offline access to data.
•	Graph Display: Provides a visual tool for comparing share prices, aiding in analysis and decision-making.
•	Input Validation: Ensures data integrity by validating user inputs.
•	Error Handling: Improves user experience by managing errors gracefully and providing clear messages.
•	User Interface: Enhances usability with an intuitive and responsive design.
•	User Preferences: Provides flexibility and convenience by allowing customization and saving of preferences and graphs.
•	Security: Protects user data and ensures compliance with privacy regulations.
