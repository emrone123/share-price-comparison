/**
 * Architecture Configuration Documentation
 * 
 * This class serves as documentation for the architectural styles and patterns
 * implemented in this application. No actual configuration is done here.
 * 
 * Domain-Independent Architectural Styles Implemented:
 * 
 * 1. Layered Architecture
 *    - Presentation Layer: Controllers (StockViewController, StockApiController)
 *    - Service Layer: Services (StockDataService, YahooFinanceStockDataService)
 *    - Data Access Layer: Repositories (StockPriceRepository)
 *    - Domain Layer: Domain models (StockPrice)
 * 
 * 2. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
 *    - Model: Domain objects (StockPrice) and Services
 *    - View: Thymeleaf templates (index.html, compare.html)
 *    - Controller: Web controllers (StockViewController, StockApiController)
 * 
 * 3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
 *    - Modular services with clear interfaces (StockDataService)
 *    - Service implementation that can be swapped (YahooFinanceStockDataService)
 *    - RESTful API exposing services (StockApiController)
 *    - Service modularity and interoperability
 * 
 * 4. N-Tier Architecture
 *    - Presentation Tier: Thymeleaf templates and controllers
 *    - Business Logic Tier: Service implementations
 *    - Data Tier: Repositories and database
 * 
 * 5. Adapter Pattern
 *    - YahooFinanceStockDataService adapts external data source to our domain model
 *    - Controllers adapt HTTP requests to service calls
 * 
 * 6. Pipes and Filters
 *    - Data flows from repository -> service -> controller -> view
 *    - Each component processes the data without knowing details of other components
 * 
 * 7. Blackboard (Repository Pattern)
 *    - StockPriceRepository serves as a central knowledge base
 *    - Services and controllers consult and update this central repository
 * 
 * Important SOA Principles Implemented:
 * 
 * 1. Service Modularity
 *    - Services are self-contained and focused on specific business capabilities
 *    - Clear interfaces separate implementation from contract
 * 
 * 2. Service Interoperability
 *    - Common data formats (JSON for API, domain objects internally)
 *    - Standard communication protocols (HTTP/REST)
 * 
 * 3. Service Reusability
 *    - Services can be used by multiple clients (web UI, API)
 *    - Generic interfaces allow for different implementations
 * 
 * 4. Service Autonomy
 *    - Services have control over their logic and resources
 *    - Services maintain their own data if needed
 * 
 * 5. Service Statelessness
 *    - Services don't maintain client state between requests
 *    - Each request contains all the information needed
