# Reward and Recognition System

We believe that it is imports to acknowledge members based on the work that put in and the dedication that they have shown. One of the rewars that we have is that the person that has put in the most amount of effort and dedication can pick the task that they would like to do in the following sprints this shows grattitude and show the group members thats its important to put in work and show them that hard work and decication will be seen and rewarded.

# Accountability and Enforcement

### Accountability:

 We expect that every member will show the highest level of maturity and fairly contribute to each sprint. 

### Punishment System:

If there is a case in which one of the goup members breaks our Code of Conduct we have created a consequence plan based on the level rule they break.

As follows: 

### Minor

These are little setbacks to the projects. Verbal warning is enough.

These can include:

- Verbal Feedback: A discussion will be held to talk about the violation that has been made and we will speak about the ways of improvement.
- Performance Plan: A plan with code of conduct expectations and the deadlines 

### Moderate

This is where the procejt can be impacted alot however there is still time for corrections 

- Action: The person would have to work overtime on the project and explain to the wholle group why they didnt inform the other goup members.

### Severe

This is where the project is significantly impacted

- Investigation: Since the problem would be serious we would have to do a serious look in the issue and what is happening before doing more serious actions such as removing the person out of the group
- Documentation: After each of these encounters its good to record what was discussed. This could help in future problems

# Ask Questions & Feedback

It is important that people ask and have questions regarding the code of conduct so that we can avoid delay in work and conflicts between group members.

In order to keep the code of conduct efficient we will discuss as a group what can be improved and what we can add these changes will be applied after further examination.
